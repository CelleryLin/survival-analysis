# HCC Survival Analysis System Frontend Demo

### Website: [https://cellerylin.github.io/survival-analysis/](https://cellerylin.github.io/survival-analysis/)

A Demo of web-based clinical decision support tool for predicting 5-year survival rates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze multiple clinical indicators and provide survival probability estimates to assist healthcare professionals in treatment planning.

## üè• Overview

The HCC Survival Analysis System is designed to help medical professionals assess the prognosis of liver cancer patients by analyzing up to 40 different clinical parameters including:

- **Patient Demographics**: Age, sex, BMI
- **Liver Function**: Cirrhosis status, Child-Pugh classification, ascites, encephalopathy
- **Laboratory Values**: AFP, bilirubin, INR, albumin, GPT, creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count
- **Tumor Characteristics**: Size, number, distribution, metastasis status, BCLC staging
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, hypertension, renal disease
- **Treatment Methods**: Various therapeutic interventions including surgery, ablation, TACE, targeted therapy

## üöÄ Features

- **Bilingual Support**: Interface available in Traditional Chinese and English
- **Interactive Form**: Comprehensive patient data input with validation
- **Real-time Analysis**: Immediate survival rate prediction upon form submission
- **Detailed Results**: Visual presentation of survival probability with risk categorization
- **Clinical Recommendations**: Automated generation of follow-up suggestions based on risk level
- **Print/Export**: Generate reports for clinical documentation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
